# Simon-Game
This repository contains the code for a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game. Test your memory and reaction time as you repeat a sequence of colored lights and sounds!

### Features

* Play against the computer in a challenging game of Simon Says.
* A sequence of colored lights is displayed, and you must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored buttons.
* The game progressively increases the sequence length as you succeed, testing your memory.
* Enjoy vibrant colors and engaging sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience.

### Getting Started

1. *Clone the repository:*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/revanthallenki/Simon-Game.git
   

2. *Open the index.html file in your web browser:*

   You can open the file directly from your browser or use a local development server like Live Server or Python's SimpleHTTPServer.

### Gameplay

1. *Start the game:* Click the "Start Game" button.
2. *Observe the sequence:* The game will display a sequence of colored lights accompanied by sounds.
3. *Repeat the sequence:* Click the colored buttons in the same order as the displayed sequence.
4. *Progress and Difficulty:* If you succeed, the game will display a longer sequence for you to repeat. The challenge increases as the sequence length grows.
5. *Game Over:* If you make a mistake by clicking the wrong button or failing to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends.

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the layout and appearance of the colored buttons and game interface.
* JavaScript: Adds interactivity by handling button clicks, generating random sequences, controlling game logic (sequence generation, user input validation, scorekeeping), and playing sounds.

### Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and make the game your own! You can add difficulty levels, implement a scoring system, introduce new sound effects, or create visual animations for the lights.
